## Comments 
First, I tried to combine human and animals together. However, I found that it did not perform well.  
I found that two pictures should have the same context, so I chose two characters from Game of Thrones and combined them.  
Nevertheless, I found hairstyle and faces still are issues while constructing hybird images, and thus I chose different images instead.  
Last, I tried to combine dog and wolf together and set it to grayscale for a better result.
